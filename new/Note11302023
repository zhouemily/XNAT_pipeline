1.see testlog and 11302023.log for some details (use dos2unix to clean up nonprintable chars)
2.script updated: run.py XNAT_file_pipleline.py to create new dicom file, then zip them and upload the zip file 
(need a subject value to submit the zip file
3.created two files for environmental variables: ~/bashrc : set python module path, there is a version conflict
which is solved by using PYTHONPATH, which will search in two direcotories (the order MATTERS, !)
4.may need to remove certain key:value pairs if not existing
5../run.py -i CUPS.log -p path will created needed dicom files in ./dcm_dir and zip them as ./CUPS.DICOM.zip
6. ./xnat_sesnd.py will send the zip file to the XNAT1 server

Please note:
1. environmental varibles need to be set correctly using ~/.bashrc
export PYTHONPATH=......
otherwise, python version conflicts show many run time errors
2. no login passwd should be included in the script for security
~/.netrc is used for extract login passwd (it should be encripted and no plain text passwd).
3. cups_id_list should be created only once and remove certain invalid ids
4. certain key:value pairs are not available, which will be removed by updating the script
5. subject value needed for final submission with xnat_send.py
